FAQ: CS2002 Logic Practical, 2023-2024
======================================

Q1. What do the symbols # and > mean?

A1. # represents XOR and > represents implies (i.e. material implication).
    This is explained in the practical spec so please read that carefully.  

Q2. Can I use C standard library feature X? 

A2. Yes, if it is in the C standard library, you may use it in your code.
This applies if it is needed at link time, not just compile time

Q3. Is it true that the number of variables in the first argument need not
match with the number of variables in the formula given?

A3. Yes.  The variables as defined by the spec are given by the number of the
first argument.  So e.g. if this is 5 then the variables are abcde and your
truth table should have 32 lines, even if some of the variables do not appear
in the formula.  Note that if a variable is outside the range given in the
first argument then it should trigger an error.  E.g. if the first argument is
5, the formula should not contain any variable past e.

Q4. Doesn't that mean that I might not be able to use mnemonic variables in
the second part of the practical? 

A4. Yes, if your encoding would be easiest with two variables q and z, you would
probably want to rename them to a and b so your truth table would have 4 lines
instead of millions. 

Q5. In Part 2, am I right in thinking that I should describe in my report 
how I convert the questions in Part 2 into two parameters needed by ttable, 
and then input the converted parameters into ttable to present the result? 

A5. Yes. Explain the encoding into logic in the report, then run the truth table 
and explain how its results answer the question.
